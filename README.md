Hello there!! 

I'm Eduardo Fernandes, originally from Florianopolis, Brazil, but now proudly calling Canada home for the past nine years. 
My academic journey led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, which laid a solid foundation for my career path. However, my passion for technology and software led me to further my education with a diploma in Software Engineering Technology and Project Management. 

Currently, I'm thriving in the role of a Business Analyst, where I get to bridge the gap between business needs and technological solutions.

Beyond the realms of business and technology, I lead a dynamic life. You might catch me soaring through the skies as a private pilot student, chasing the thrill of adventure and exploration. And when grounded, I enjoy the company of my loyal companion, Zoey, my four-legged friend who brightens every moment with her presence.

Join me on my journey as I explore the intersections of business, technology, and aviation right here on GitHub! Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects together.
